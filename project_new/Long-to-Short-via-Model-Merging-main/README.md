## 🔥 Early Test on DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B

We directly merge the R1-Qwen3-8B with the Qwen3-8B (as base) models using TIES-Merging with `k = 0.7, α = 0.7`. We sample 16 answers for each question and calculate the the average score (`generation_parameters: max_new_tokens = 32768, temperature = 0.6, top_p = 0.95, top_k = 20}`).

| Model           | R1-0528-Qwen3-8B          | Merged Qwen3-8B                 | 
|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| AIME24  | 70.63 (11328.25)        | 74.58 (6448.5)           |

According to [Qwen3's guidelines](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B), there are two ways to achieve the switch between the /think and /no_think modes, i.e. `enable_thinking=False|True` and appending `/think | /no_think` to the instruction.

- Extensive experiments on R1-Qwen3-8B reveal that the no_think capability has been completely diminished in both modes, resulting in excessively lengthy responses.
- Our merged model perserves the no_think ability according to our testing. We found that the model can directly generate the answer part by setting `enable_thinking=False`. However, the alternative switch mode triggered by the `/no_think` keyword appears to fail in most cases.

*Stay tuned to our more new results!*

## Summary of our findings 🔥🔥🔥:

- Model merging is a highly efficient approach for long-to-short reasoning, as it directly operates on model parameters **without requiring additional training**.

- Task-vector based merging methods, especially like TA and Ties-Merging, can achieve long-to-short reasoning with around **50\% length reduction** alongside **accuracy parity or even marginal gains** on 7B models. 
  
- SVD-based merging methods exhibit limited effectiveness, delivering moderate performance and serving as viable alternatives only when task vectors inherently possess low-rank spectral characteristics.
  
- Activation-based merging is the future, as it demonstrates impressive performance in terms of both reasoning accuracy (+1.9) and response length compression ratios (-49.8\%).
  
- Model merging methods applied to 1.5B-scale models remain effective on simple tasks. Smaller models struggle to learn long CoT reasoning ability through model merging. 
  
- The merging of large-scale models (14B and 32B) poses significant challenges in simultaneously maintaining reasoning performance while substantially reducing response length.

## Environments
For merging methods:
```angular2html
numpy==1.26.4
torch==2.5.1
transformers==4.48.2
```

For the evaluation, we recommend following the usage of [[Qwen2.5-Math Eval Toolkit]](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math).

## Implementation

Our implementation is adapted from [MergeLM](https://github.com/yule-BUAA/MergeLM). We optimize the code of some merging methods, such as TA and Ties-Merging, for computational efficiency.

### Average merging

```shell
python src/main_merging.py --merge_method average_merging \
                           --output_dir DIR \
                           --base_model MODEL_PATH \
                           --models_to_merge MODEL_PATH1,MODEL_PATH2,...,MODEL_PATHn
```

### Task Arithmetic
```shell
python src/main_merging.py --merge_method task_arithmetic \
                           --output_dir DIR \
                           --base_model MODEL_PATH \
                           --models_to_merge MODEL_PATH1,MODEL_PATH2,...,MODEL_PATHn \
                           --scaling_coefficient α
```

### Ties-Merging
```shell
python src/main_merging.py --merge_method ties_merging/ties_merging_dare \
                           --output_dir DIR \
                           --base_model MODEL_PATH \
                           --models_to_merge MODEL_PATH1,MODEL_PATH2,...,MODEL_PATHn \
                           --scaling_coefficient α \
                           --param_value_mask_rate k
```

Note: You can choose to use `ties_merging` that we optimize the implementation for better computational efficiency or `ties_merging_dare` which is the original implementation in MergeLM. We have compared two implementations and find the results are comparable.

### DARE
```shell
python src/main_merging.py --merge_method mask_merging \
                           --output_dir DIR \
                           --base_model MODEL_PATH \
                           --models_to_merge MODEL_PATH1,MODEL_PATH2,...,MODEL_PATHn \
                           --scaling_coefficient α \
                           --param_value_mask_rate k \
                           --mask_apply_method [average_merging || task_arithmetic || ties_merging || ties_merging_dare] \
                           --weight_mask_rates p
```

### AIM & Sens-Merging
We will release the code of activation-based methods soon. Stay tuned!

### Evaluations

```shell
git clone https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math.git
cd Qwen2.5-Math-main/evaluation
```

Move `src/evaluation/data_process.py` and `src/evaluation/l2s_eval.sh` as following:

```markdown
Qwen2.5-Math-Main/evaluation
├── sh
│   ├── l2s_eval.sh
├── data
│   ├── math500
├── outputs
│   ├── ...
├── data_process.py
└── ...
```

Note: [MATH500](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/MATH-500) are not in original database. You should manually add it to `Qwen2.5-Math-Main/evaluation/data`.

Run the evaluation:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3" bash sh/l2s_eval.sh [PROMPT_TYPE:qwen25-math-cot] [MODEL_PATH] [MAX_TOKEN:10240] [NUM_SHOTS:0] [DATASETS:aime24,math500,gsm8k,college_math,minerva_math,olympiadbench]
```

To make sure the reproducibility of the results, we set `temperature=0`, `top_p=1`.
